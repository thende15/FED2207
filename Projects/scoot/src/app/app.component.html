<!-- Alright, flow time. 
Routing is a must, and I'm not worried about that. 
Four major components, each page needs a series of smaller ones. Five if we count nav. 
Might be able to make cards with a single component. Will play with this alongside ngClass.
I realize that we'll need six main components. Four for the site, one for nav, one for
footer. Might be able to make a universal banner comp for different data.  -->
